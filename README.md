# Confessions Markov Visualization

> *On an average day, there are about 60 confessions broadcasted on the Tufts Confessions Facebook page. The page receives about 1132 confessions in a given month and since its creation in 2013, it has posted nearly 25,000 anonymous confessions of Tufts students. Clearly, we have a lot to say. But what are we all talking about and is it important?*

 An interactive chord diagram of the Markov model of Tufts Confessions. In natural language processing, there is literature that suggests that natural language can be modelled by a Markov process - a series of probabilistic transitions between states. This chord diagram attemptes to capture such a process for Tufts Confessions based on textual data.
